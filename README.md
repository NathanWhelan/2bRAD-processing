# 2bRAD-processing
Basic scripts to process raw 2bRAD data

Requires BioPerl

The bash script uses GNU Parallel and scripts from Eli Meyer's 2bRAD pipeline(s). https://github.com/Eli-Meyer/2bRAD_utilities

The AlfIExtract_mod.pl script is modified to reflect that the first base pair of the AlfI locus is trimmed
